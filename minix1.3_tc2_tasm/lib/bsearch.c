/*  bsearch(3)
 *
 *  Author: Terrence Holm          Aug. 1988
 *
 *
 *  Performs a binary search for a given <key> within a sorted
 *  table. The table contains <count> entries of size <width>
 *  and starts at <base>.
 *
 *  Entries are compared using keycmp( key, entry ), each argument
 *  is a (char *), the function returns an int < 0, = 0 or > 0
 *  according to the order of the two arguments.
 *
 *  Bsearch(3) returns a pointer to the matching entry, if found,
 *  otherwise NULL is returned.
