/*  strtok(3)

 *
 *
 *  This function is used to divide up a string into tokens.
 *  Strtok(3) is called with <string> pointing to the string
 *  to be scanned and <char_set> pointing to a string which
 *  consists of the set of separator characters. Tokens are
 *  substrings bordered by separator characters. A pointer to
 *  the first token encountered is returned. If <string> is
 *  NULL then the scan is continued from the last token
 *  returned. Each token is terminated by a '\0'. If there are
 *  no tokens remaining in the string then NULL is returned.
