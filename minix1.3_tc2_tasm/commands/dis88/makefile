# This Makefile  automates the process of compiling and linking
# a symbolic  object-file  disassembler  program  for the Intel
# 8088 CPU. Relatively machine-independent code is contained in
# the file dismain.c; lookup tables and handler routines, which
# are by their nature  machine-specific,  are  contained in two
# files named distabs.c and dishand.c,  respectively.  (A third
# machine-specific file, disfp.c, contains handler routines for
# floating-point  coprocessor opcodes.)  A header file,  dis.h,
# attempts to mediate between the machine-specific and machine-
# independent portions of the code. An attempt has been made to
# isolate machine  dependencies and to deal with them in fairly
# straightforward ways. Thus, it should be possible to target a
# different CPU by rewriting the handler  routines and changing
# the initialization  data in the lookup tables.  It should not
# be necessary to alter the formats of the tables.
